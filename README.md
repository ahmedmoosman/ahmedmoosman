### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Doctoral researcher at @unitrento. I am also @UNIDO consultant for Value chain analysis

* I am working increasingly with @R only
* I have a lot of code in Python, particularly spatial stuff
* I am a huge fan of GitHub for teaching, so all my material is distributed via a repo

Drop me a line to say hello  ðŸ‘‹! Or Iskawaran or Waryaa ðŸ˜„
